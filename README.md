# Introduction

This is a project for running through the Rust Code Challenges course on LinkedIn Learning found here: <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rust-code-challenges>

## Dev container setup

This project is setup to use the [Visual Studio Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension.  This allows you to develop in a containerised environment that has all the tools and dependencies you need to build and run the project.

This will automatically setup a development environment for you and install the extensions for vscode which are recommended. I've also added GitHub Copilot to this list as it's a great tool for generating code snippets.
